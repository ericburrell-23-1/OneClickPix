# OneClickPix
XCode Project for the OneClickPix photo ordering app

## Description
The OneClickPix App is a photo ordering service provided by D&M Imaging Inc. to allow anyone to order high quality finished prints from their iPhone.

## Project Status
Development of the OneClickPix app is in its early stages currently. UI is still being developed, and retrieving and managing data from the server is the top priority of development right now. It will then be crucial to display server information such as product offerings within the app, and then fine tune the UI/UX.

### Roadmap
Following UI and API development, additional features will have to be added, chiefly login/account settings, and in-App payments.

After these features have been added, then final testing will be conducted with the server deployed, and then an initial release to the App Store will be pursued.
